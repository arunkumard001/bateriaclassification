# bacteria classification
INTRODUCTION
Bacteria are prokaryotic microorganisms that appear in different shapes and size.
They are usually unicellular that are found in a wide variety of habitat. Usually optical instruments such as electron microscope are used to visualise them. They can
be beneficial to humankind because they helps in the process of fermentation and
decomposition of solid wastes. On the other hand they are dangerous as these set
of microorganisms causes many diseases in human beings such as skin diseases, urinary tract infections,sexually transmitted diseases etc. Hence the identification and
classification of bacteria becomes important. The identification and classification of
bacteria comes under the field of microbiology which uses conventional methods for
the same. In conventional methods body fluids like blood, urine,saliva etc. of the
patients are analysed using an electron microscope. The microscopic image obtained
is used for the detection of the bacteria. For the detection of complex bacterium
after obtaining the microscopic images biochemical test are to be done. This requires highly trained personnel for testing and it is time consuming. Accuracy of the
detection is the next challenge that arise in the conventional method. Thus there is
a need for a better system.
Bacteria classification using image processing and deep learning is a system which
mainly focuses on identification and classification of bacteria in an efficient way. Thus
it replaces most of the demerits possessed by the conventional methods.
In this system a digital image of the bacteria is obtained with the help of a digital
camera attached to the electron microscope. Then this image is given to our system
which is trained to identify the bacteria. Thus the given bacteria can be easily identified. This system is trained with three different classes of bacteria namely Escherichia
coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis
